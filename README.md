### Agent based language models
UG research scholarship project. Built on previous language shift study. Developed agent-based simulations of a bilingual environment using Irish census data in Python. Used NumPy, SciPy, SciKitLearn, matplotlib, NetworkX to construct graphs and simulate language interactions between agents. Investigated effects of different network topologies along with the effects of modifications to the network by connecting agents.

### Language shift study
Final year project. Used machine learning to predict future trends in Irish language use. Built, compared and contrasted a neural network approach and an epidemiological model approach using SciKitLearn, NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib . Mapped results using Central Statistics Office map data and GeoPandas Python library.
